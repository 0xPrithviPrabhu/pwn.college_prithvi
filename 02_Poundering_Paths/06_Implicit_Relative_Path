# Challenge Name
challenge is about how to write or go to file using implicit path

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kmrSxuucXaB_IO-XiIcGyr8WeT8.QX5QTN0wSM1kjNzEzW}`

It was mentioned that I should go to root and then using implicit path go to file called run.
My thought process was to first analyze the command I was given: challenge/run. I immediately noticed that it did not start with a forward slash (/), which told me it was a relative path.

Step 1: Understanding the Requirement
I knew that for a relative path to work, I must be in the correct starting directory. The path challenge/run means "look for a folder named challenge inside my current location, then find the run program inside it."

Step 2: Finding the Correct Position
My logical deduction was that the challenge folder must be located in the root directory (/) of the filesystem. Therefore, to make the relative path work, I first had to move to the root directory.

Step 3: Execution
First, I navigated to the root directory. Then, from that correct position, I executed the relative path provided.

```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
