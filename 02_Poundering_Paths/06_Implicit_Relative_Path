challenge is about how to write or go to file using implicit path

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kmrSxuucXaB_IO-XiIcGyr8WeT8.QX5QTN0wSM1kjNzEzW}`

It was mentioned that I should go to root and then using implicit path go to file called run.
```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kmrSxuucXaB_IO-XiIcGyr8WeT8.QX5QTN0wSM1kjNzEzW}
```
